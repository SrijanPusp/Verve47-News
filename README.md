# Verve47 News

Verve47 News is a web-based news aggregation platform that fetches real-time news from an external API and displays categorized news articles. Users can browse different categories such as Global, National, Finance, and Politics, and search for specific news topics.

## Features

- **Live News Fetching:** The website fetches real-time news from an external API asynchronously.
- **Category Filtering:** Users can navigate different categories like Global, National, Finance, and Politics.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for specific keywords to find relevant news articles.
- **Responsive UI:** A clean and modern design that works well on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – For the frontend and UI design.
- **Fetch API & Async/Await** – For making asynchronous calls to fetch news from the API.
- **Vercel** – Used for deployment.

## Project Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned about:

- **Fetching APIs using Fetch API** and handling responses asynchronously.
- **Using `async` and `await`** to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.
- **Manipulating the DOM dynamically** to display fetched news articles.
- **Implementing search functionality** to filter articles based on user input.
